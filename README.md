## Terminal Based Chess Game in C
This is a terminal-based chess game implemented in C. The game allows two players to compete against each other or a single player to play against the computer. It features a simple text-based interface where players can input their moves in the format:
```
<source_sq><destination_sq>
e.g. e2e4, a7a5, etc.
```
The game includes all the standard rules of chess, such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. The computer opponent uses basic algorithms to make decisions, providing a reasonable challenge for casual players.
